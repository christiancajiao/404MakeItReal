## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See a responsive design for the 404 error with an image and a button


### Screenshot


<img src="./design/desktop-preview.jpg" width="700">



## My process

We speak about how can solve the desing in the webpage, and decide to make it with flexbox, create a repository in github and uploaded the new interface taking for base the ones from the makeitreal repository, after that we make the design responsive using the media query offer by css

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

We learn about the SHH keys in github, learn about flex and media querys in css

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
 <div class="image-container">
   <img class="image" src="../assets/scarecrow.png"></img>
 </div>
```
```css
@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {
}
```

### Continued development

We think maybe we can improve in github and the use of more breakpoints in the responsive desing 


### Useful resources
